### This repository contains all wanted documentation and codes for Special Topics in Remote Sensing course. 

- The video ["Yeni Başlayanlar İçin 90 Dakikada Git"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX8bHqXt8ws&t=4777s&ab_channel=ArinYazilim) was first watched to understand the logic of the Github site and Git.
- Then I watched the ["Yeni Başlayanlar İçin 80 Dakikada GitHub"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihoPT325jyk&t=2310s&ab_channel=ArinYazilim) video promoting Github using git.
- I watched the video of the same channel about [using Jupyter Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayLW3gfuanU&ab_channel=ArinYazilim).
- After my research, I discovered geemap, a python library and watched the [video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAxJ4-o7ZoPccOFv1dCwvGI6TYnirRTg3) describing this library and its use. This video series was prepared by the developer of the library.
- This library is based on the Google Earth Engine codes described in the 11th week lecture. That's why I downloaded the geemap library along with the gee library in my code.
- [The Google Earth Engine site](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides), which has been mentioned and used a lot in the video series, was a resource for me. I found the python codes from the site with mostly java codes and expanded my knowledge by following these codes myself.


The code I wrote does not contain an image input, it takes the images from Google Earth Engine.

In my codes, I set the map center to the Karaburun Peninsula in Izmir, the location I chose and whose temporal resolution I wanted to observe.But I completely left the user to adjust the size of the satellite image, as well as the size of the images to create the gif.

The source code I used in the homework is the code I got from the [4th video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EUTX8j-YVM&list=PLAxJ4-o7ZoPccOFv1dCwvGI6TYnirRTg3&index=5&ab_channel=QiushengWu) of the video series I watched. I created an interactive and user-selectable map panel where dual comparison of Landsat 8 images from 1990 to 2019 can be compared.

Finally, I used code to create the gif from the [18th video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwjSJnGWKJs&list=PLAxJ4-o7ZoPccOFv1dCwvGI6TYnirRTg3&index=19&ab_channel=QiushengWu) of the video series I watched. In this code, I created the time-lapse gif of the satellite images of Landsat 8 from 1990 to 2019 and saved it in the output folder on my computer.

I have saved all the process steps both on my computer and in my github folder using git.
